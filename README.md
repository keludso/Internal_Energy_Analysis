# Internal_Energy_Analysis

This package is a Matlab version of MULTIWELL developed by Dr Barker and team at University of Michigan Ann Arbor to include the microwave effects in chemical reactions. The program calculates the internal energy distribution, reaction rates, Trajectories reacted. The code has an inclusion for microwave absorption. The photon absorbed at 
microwave frequencies using a multiphoton abosption model is demonstrated.
